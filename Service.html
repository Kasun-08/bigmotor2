 <p>Engine is one of the key elements of a vehicle and it is important to ensure that the moving parts of the engine are properly lubricated to avoid damages to the engine while the engine operates. The lubricant in the engine plays the key role in maintaining smoothness among the moving parts of the engine and reducing the friction of each part while the engine operates. Over time, engine lubricant gets contaminated with dust, dirt, and debris from the engine as well as the environment. Therefore, it is important to maintain the periodical lubricant change in the engine to refresh the engine lubricant and ensure the proper functioning of the engine.</p>
